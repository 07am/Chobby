Chobby, the ingame lobby.

Installation
============
Chobby is on rapid, under the "chobby" tag. The development version can be obtained directly from here.

To download with pr-downloader use this command line:

    pr-downloader chobby:test "Blank v1"

Launching
=========

You can launch Chobby from spring start menu like any other game. 

It is suggested to select "Player Only" script and it's a good idea to use [Blank v1](http://api.springfiles.com/?springname=Blank%20v1&category=map) as your map. Other small maps can also work pretty well.

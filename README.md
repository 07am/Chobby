Chobby, the ingame lobby.

Installation
============
Chobby is on rapid, under the "chobby" tag. The development version can be obtained directly from here.

Launching
=========

You can launch Chobby from spring start menu like any other game. 

It is suggested to select "Player Only" script and it's a good idea to use [Blank v2](https://springrts.com/phpbb/download/file.php?id=9278) as your map. Other small maps can also work pretty well.
